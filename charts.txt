what about https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api - would I be able to fetch the hourly data for free ?

Using the Binance API is a popular alternative, but there is one major catch for your specific "EUR/USD" request: Binance is a crypto exchange, not a traditional forex broker.

Here is how it works for your Next.js app:

1. Is it Free?
Yes. Binance's market data endpoints (Klines/Candlesticks) are public and free. You do not even need an API key to fetch historical price data for charting.

Endpoint: GET /api/v3/klines

Data: It provides Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) and volume data.

Granularity: You can choose 1h (hourly) easily.

2. The "EUR/USD" Problem
Binance does not have a direct EUR/USD pair because they do not trade traditional "Fiat vs Fiat" pairs. They trade "Crypto vs Fiat" or "Crypto vs Stablecoin."

The closest alternative: EUR/USDT (Euro vs Tether stablecoin).

Since USDT (Tether) is usually pegged 1:1 to the USD, the EURUSDT chart is 99.9% identical to a EUR/USD forex chart.

Symbol to use: EURUSDT

3. Fetching Hourly Data (Code Example)
To fetch the last 100 hours of data for your TradingView chart:

JavaScript
// URL for 1-hour candles for EUR/USDT
const url = "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=EURUSDT&interval=1h&limit=100";

const fetchBinanceData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();

  // Binance returns an array of arrays. Map it to Lightweight Charts format:
  return data.map(candle => ({
    time: candle[0] / 1000, // Convert ms to seconds
    open: parseFloat(candle[1]),
    high: parseFloat(candle[2]),
    low: parseFloat(candle[3]),
    close: parseFloat(candle[4]),
  }));
};
4. Comparison: ExchangeRate-API vs. Binance
Feature	ExchangeRate-API (v6)	Binance API
Asset Type	Real Forex (EUR/USD)	Crypto/Stablecoin (EUR/USDT)
Cost	Paid for Hourly/History	Free
Setup	Requires API Key	No Key Required for public data
Data Format	Simple Rates	Full Candlestick (OHLC)
Speed	Fast	Extremely Fast (WebSockets available)
Summary Recommendation
If you need "Real" Forex accuracy: Stick with a Forex provider like ExchangeRate-API (Paid), OANDA, or Polygon.io (limited free tiers).

If you want a free, high-performance chart for a hobby/dev project: Use Binance EURUSDT. It is free, supports hourly (and even 1-minute) data, and works perfectly with TradingView Lightweight Charts because it provides the Open, High, Low, Close values needed for professional-looking candlestick charts.
